The CopyOnWrite library provides a .NET layer on top of OS-specific logic that provides copy-on-write linking for files (a.k.a. CoW, file cloning, or reflinking). CoW linking provides the ability to copy a file without actually copying the original file's bytes from one disk location to another. The filesystem is in charge of ensuring that if the original file is modified or deleted, the CoW linked files remain unmodified by lazily copying the original file's bytes into each link. Unlike symlinks or hardlinks, writes to CoW links do not write through to the original file, as the filesystem breaks the link and copies in a lazy fashion. This enables scenarios like file caches where a single copy of a file held in a content-addressable or other store is safely linked to many locations in a filesystem with low I/O overhead.

This library allows a .NET developer to:

* Discover whether CoW links are allowed between two filesystem paths,
* Discover whether CoW links are allowed for a directory tree based at a specific root directory,
* Create CoW links,
* Find filesystem CoW link limits.

Discovery is important, as different operating systems and different filesystems available for those operating systems provide varying levels of CoW link support:

* Windows: The default NTFS filesystem does NOT support CoW, but the ReFS filesystem does.
* Linux: Btrfs, Xfs, Zfs support CoW while ext4 does not.
* Mac: AppleFS supports CoW by default.

When using this library you may need to create a wrapper that copies the file if CoW is not available.


## Example
```c#
using Microsoft.CopyOnWrite;

ICopyOnWriteFilesystem cow = CopyOnWriteFilesystemFactory.GetInstance();
bool canCloneInCurrentDirectory = cow.CopyOnWriteLinkSupportedInDirectoryTree(Environment.CurrentDirectory);
if (canCloneInCurrentDirectory)
{
    cow.CloneFile(existingFile, cowLinkFilePath);
}
```

### Running Unit Tests on Windows
If you have a local ReFS drive volume on which to run ReFS related tests, set the following user or system level environment variable:

  `CoW_Test_ReFS_Drive=D:\`

(You may need to exit and restart VS, VSCode, or consoles after setting this.)
When this env var is not available, unit tests create and mount a local ReFS VHD for testing.
You must run tests elevated (as admin), e.g. by opening Visual Studio as an admin before opening the solution.


## Performance Comparisons

### Windows
CoW links on ReFS take approximately constant time, saving time over file copies except at file size zero. The savings is proportional to the file size, with 16MB files at about 35X performance, 1MB at 3.2X, and small sizes at about 1.3X.

Detailed numbers for a VHD formatted empty with ReFS for each iteration, comparing `System.IO.File.Copy()` with `CloneFile()`, 25 copies/clones of a single source file per measurement. See CoWComparisons.cs. Machine was an 8/16-core M.2 SSD, Win10 21H1 Enterprise.
